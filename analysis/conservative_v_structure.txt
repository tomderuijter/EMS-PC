For all X,Y,Z, s.t. adj(X,Y) and adj(Z,Y) and NOT adj(X,Z): (all unshielded triples)
    For all subsets S1 of adj(X) and all subsets S2 of adj(Z): (subsets of all potential parents of X and Z)
        (a) If Y is NOT in any set S1,S2 s.t. independent(X,Z|S1) or independent(X,Z|S2)
            Orient X->Y<-Z.
        
        (b) If Y is in ALL sets S1,S2 s.t. independent(X,Z|S1) or independent(X,Z|S2)
            Orient X-Y-Z.
            
        (c) If (a) or (b) does not apply
            Mark X-Y-Z unfaithful
