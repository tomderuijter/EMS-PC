Free parameters 
- Subject number (1-6)
- P-value acceptance (default 0.05)
- Vertex permutation (default 1-116)

Possible problems with PC:
- Causal Markov Condition (D-seperation?) does not hold
- Graph is not faithful
- Dependency test (Fisher) does not model the data well
- The data is not a correct representation of the model

Possible ideas and questions
- Does keeping structure constant and permuting before finding v-structures make a difference?
- Add repair algorithm to PC
- Modify PC to search over entire space of order N and not stop once one is found.
- Data is highly temporal dependent. Average overlay of data points: 1-100, 2-101,3-102, etc.
- How does Maxâ€™s method and partial correlation influence directionality of resulting models?
- Test for smaller number of variables (1-10)
- Average over a large amount of permutations
- Vary independency acceptance threshold
- Why is edge direction so dependent on vertex permutation?
- How will we tackle cross-subject comparison?

- Retest sepsets for unknown symmetric connections
- Incorporate partial correlation in direction rules

Results
- Test for smaller number of variables
The goal behind this test was whether results for structure_PC and directional_PC differ if you take small subsets of variables.
We found that directional_PC does not find any neighbours in subject 1 and we want to exclude this is a fault in the method. 



I have tested structure_PC for generated data (2000 points) from the asia network. We do find neighbour edges, coexisting with directional edges.

- Why do we not find bidirectional edges? 
Because structure_pc does not take into account latent causal sources.
For that we have to implemented extended PC as described in Spirtes et al.

- Why is edge direction so dependent on vertex permutation?
Comparison with the toolbox directional module also shows similar results.
We believe it is therefore safe to assume this is inherent to PC.
