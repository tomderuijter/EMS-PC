– The problem

We will attempt to apply causal discovery methods on structural / functional connectivity data on resting state fMRI data.
We want to provide more insight into the question whether causal discovery methods can provide a means for findin effective connectivity.
Note: it is still unclear to us how Tom's method work and wether we need to provide a connectivity graph or a set of vertices with data.

– Motivation 
Open questions in this area. See motivation of references
Methods for finding Effective Connectivity are relatively new and suffer from several problems.
Ask Tom, Tom & Max.
...

– Theoretical scope
(Bayesian) Brain Connectomics & standard methods for measuring/computing
Hierarchical compositions of networks
Difficulties in effective connectivity / causal discovery
Tom C's method/software
Which methods we will be comparing with
How we think to overcome certain difficulties

-- Data
Max: 76 subjects, structural data and resting state fMRI data
select 6 subjects according to some criterion

– Strategy
We will use the data (voxel or connectivity data?) and apply the causal discovery algorithm, resulting in a directed graph.
We will look at whether this graph adds useful information: either by cross subject comparison, or by simulation. 
No true baseline exist for connectivity data,
We will verify this causal discovery method adaptation(yet to be named) by comparing it to existing methods for finding effective connectivity.
We will use the data described above for comparison.

 

'Interesting' properties:
- Computational properties such as scalability
- Graph theoretic measures
- Properties described in 
- BIC (?)
- ...

– Time schedule
Available time period: week 40 - 50 (1/10 - 10/12)
Note: we can provide a more specific time schedule as soon as we have more clarity on the methods and data
