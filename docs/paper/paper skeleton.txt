% Subject introduction
Effective connectivity resting state analysis in human brains
Resting state
Brains are networks; apply graphical models and causal discovery

% Motivation for research
Better understanding of brains
Relatively new field - not yet an established analysis method
Existing problems with current methods and applications, specifically [Tom: mention all, or just the relevant problems?]
- Model selection
- Indirect measurements
- Modelling causal structure across individuals (varying responses to same stimuli)
- Distinct but overlapping ROIs
- Varying Haemodynamic response (HRF)
- Equilibrium or time series [Tom: I'm not sure I understand 'equilibrium']

% Problem statement
See whether applying causal methods (PC and EMS-PC) can help bring new insights and whether we can find evidence for the existence of causal patterns on a whole brain level.

% Previous research
[Tom: we did not explicitly have this paragraph, so this is additional effort]

% Research goal
How does the standard causal discovery method PC-Algorithm behave regarding the aforementioned problems when applied to resting-state functional time-series data?

How does the performance of EMS-PC relate to PC regarding the aforementioned problems when applied to the same resting-state functional time-series data?

% Relevance of research
If HRF can be avoided, causal patterns can be established with greater reliability
Insight and diagnostics in neuro-degenerative diseases
Any found evidence of causal patterns can give an impulse to further research
