preliminaries
- causal discovery (faithfullness, latent variables, order-dependency -> multiple iterations, etc.) (*, partially)
- PC -> structure and direction (R)
	Causal discovery blabla
	Graphical models, causal discovery, bla.
	Conditional dependence
	PC Algorithm intuition, d-separation
	Model assumptions, perfect map, faithfulness, causal sufficiency (closed world) with and without, bla.
	Resulting issues, stability, scalability, complexity

- brain connectivity *
- methods for finding brain connectivity *

Methods (T)
- applying original pc 
  results for structure pretty good, too many v-structures (too order dependant), multiple iterations
- applying original pc multiple sepsets
- modified pc
- explicit pc

(- sliding window)
(- Tom's independence test)
- cross subject comparison
- comparison with provided structure
- alpha optimisation 

Discussion 
- bi-directional arrows (R)
- Analysis from probabilistic perspective
